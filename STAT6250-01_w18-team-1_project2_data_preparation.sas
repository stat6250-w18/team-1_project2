[Dataset 1 Name] enr99

[Dataset Description] School-level enrollment by racial/ethnic designation, 
gender and grade, AY1999-2000

[Experimental Unit Description] California public K-12 schools in AY1999-2000

[Number of Observations] 95,443

[Number of Features] 20

[Data Source] The file https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/filesenr.asp
was downloaded and edited to produce file filesenr_1999_2000_edited.xls by 
deleting worksheet "filesenr_1999_2000", reformatting column headers in 
"filesenr_1999_2000" to remove characters disallowed in SAS variable names, 
and setting all cell values to "Text" format

[Data Dictionary] https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/fsenr98.asp

[Unique ID Schema] The column "CDS_CODE" is the unique id in dataset enr99, 
which is also equivalent to the unique id column CDS_CODE in dataset enr09, 
droppouts00 and droppouts10.
